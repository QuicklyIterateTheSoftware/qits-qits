# Handoff

Updated 2026-08-06. Everything shipped-and-verified has been removed; history is in git
(this file's own log included). What remains is open, pending, or standing.

## In flight right now (userflow-tests worktree branch)

- **THE RE-MODEL IS LIVE (2026-08-06 ~15:30)**: clean-start bootstrap from this worktree
  completed — eleven apps healthy, all pipeline-deployed, steady state (no compose
  containers). dev on `environment/dev`, registry-owned topology, hub-and-spoke networks
  verified live. Five first-run defects fixed on the fly (registry native reflection,
  buildkit pipeline shape, health-path seeding, two lost post-receive announces + two
  lost build events) — all recorded in priority-feature.md "Debts surfaced by the first
  live run"; those debts are now the open work list. Wire note: registry serializes
  `target`, contract says `deploymentTarget` — tolerated by cd, align later.
- **qits-cli-bootstrap BUILT** (user ask): Quarkus command-mode + picocli + JLine3-
  Display TUI replacing qits-local-up.sh — modes `bootstrap` and `unwrap` (volumes kept
  by default, `--with-volumes` for the clean slate, `--dry-run`), 47 fully-ported
  state-machine phases, every remote wait showing target/state/elapsed/deadline, PlainUi
  fallback for non-TTY. 59 tests green; submodule at `cli/qits-cli-bootstrap`
  (`9040914`). **UNPROVEN: no cold bootstrap has run through it yet** — the bash script
  stays the reference until one passes (its AGENTS.md says so); likeliest first-run
  surprises are the gateway-routed ci/cd health polls and the release-run poll shape.
  It already fixes the singleton-liveness debt (ignores unhealthy containers).

- **Environment re-model implemented, NOT deployed** — design + decisions + contract
  amendments in `priority-feature.md`. Committed on `main` in each submodule (none
  pushed): qits-cd (5 commits: V4, spec source, hub-and-spoke networks, derived
  registration, singletons, PATCH, docs), qits-workspaces (release promotes
  `environment/dev`), qits-projects (CdEnvironmentNotifier removed), qits-idp +
  qits-gateway (`deployments.yml` seeds). Wrapper commits on `userflow-tests`:
  `qits-local-up.sh` (dev env, PATCH-reconcile, dual-ref pushes) + docs. All builds
  green. The adversarial review of the qits-cd diff is DONE: one live release blocker
  found (the forgotten `decoupling-probe` environment on branch `main` — runbook step 0
  in priority-feature.md deletes it on the OLD cd before anything deploys) and five
  code findings fixed on top (`69e5752`): environment-aware predecessor selection,
  legacy-network guard on delete, join failures fail the deployment, registration
  serialized onto the worker, singleton→environment flips rejected loudly. 106 tests
  green.
- **Post-review decisions**: the singletons are **qits-idp and qits-serviceregistry**
  (idp deployed today, serviceregistry planned) — the cd-singleton call was reversed
  (priority-feature.md decision 8; flip applied on the branch). The environment/
  application registry extracts into **qits-serviceregistry** later (repo created,
  empty; itself a singleton; shape-2 execution: socketless registry, a home cd deploys
  the platform plane) — paired with second-environment readiness, not part of this
  rollout.
- **Script gate CLEARED, rollout still to run**: the separate `qits-local-up.sh` fix
  landed on `main` (proven by the cold bootstrap above) and is now merged into this
  branch. The reconciliation kept both sides — main's release replays, the
  `post_build_event` helper and the lost-event replay; the branch's dev environment,
  PATCH-reconcile, dual-ref pushes and serviceregistry. Two details settled in the
  merge: the build event names the ref that DEPLOYS the application (not `main`), and
  the lost-event replay is environment-applications-only (a singleton has no row, so
  the sixty-second signal would misfire). What remains is the sequenced rollout in
  `priority-feature.md` (cd first, PATCH env immediately after — see contract
  amendment 7).
- **Userflow-tests plan parked** behind the re-model: `handover.md`.

## Awaiting user verdicts

1. **WO-b judgment call**: the merge panel left the workspaces overview (merging lives
   on the detail route). Keep it that way, or bring a merge entry point back.

Resolved 2026-08-06: the **git-storage flip executed, and the file backend retired
the same day** (user: "the disk storage should be gone"). All 41 repositories imported
and three-check-verified; every path proven live: protection + both bypasses,
post-receive → CI, repository create/import over HTTP, history reads, the full release
train (SCMRelease → event run → SoftwareRelease), workspace container provisioning, a
service deploy, and qits-artifacts redeploying itself from its own DFS store — twice,
the second time as the dfs-only binary (`508e598`). The `qits-repositories` volume is
deleted (tarball: `~/qits-git-bares-final-2026-08-06.tar.gz`), the file-backend code
is gone, and `qits-local-up.sh` seeds over the wire (home `6843faf`). Full record at
the top of git-host-storage-unification-plan.md.

Resolved 2026-08-06: the rewritten **`qits-local-up.sh` is proven end to end** — a full
cold bootstrap ran green in an isolated docker-in-docker daemon: seed stack, wire
repository creation, release replays, then all ten applications built and deployed
through the platform's own pipeline, qits-cd's self-update handoff included, gateway
healthy and the DFS git host serving clones. Five attempts; each earlier failure was a
real cold-start bug, all fixed: the `${user.home}` heredoc bashism (`b03bce2`); no
released artifacts on a fresh platform — bootstrap now replays the four publishers'
release pipelines (`3a19ed0`, `97bda56`); H2's compiled-check defect killing every run
after pool idle — V5 had dropped constraint names V1 never created; fixed for real
with a Java migration (qits-ci `4439c4b`, deployed live); stale webui gitlinks in
qits-ci/qits-cd pinning pre-CalVer `@qits/ui-components@0.0.4` (`b698b99`, `8ef8a8f`,
deployed live; qits-spa-ci's main had also never been pushed to the platform host);
and a lost fire-and-forget build-succeeded event — the deploy wait now replays it once
when a run is green with no deployment row (`97bda56`). Then the REAL platform was
torn down (containers, all volumes including the DFS store, network, every seed and
build image, the musl toolchain) and cold-bootstrapped from source on the host daemon:
green in ~22 minutes (docker layer cache carried unchanged sources), all ten
applications healthy, 32 repos on the fresh DFS host, blob API and clones serving, no
bares volume. The skip-build caveat is gone — both paths are proven. NOTE the reset:
run/deployment/event history restarted, throwaway probe repos (drift-forge, sv-train,
the UUID imports) are gone, idp client secrets were kept (.qits-bootstrap.env). This
unblocks the env re-model rollout (user's runbook).

Resolved 2026-08-06: the git host gained **content-read endpoints** (user's ask) —
`GET /artifacts/git/{repoId}/blob/{rev}/{path}` (raw bytes) and `…/tree/{rev}[/{path}]`
(JSON listing), `{rev}` a branch/tag or full sha, resolved sha in the `Git-Commit-Sha`
header, unauthenticated like the rest of the host (qits-artifacts `3f8ca71`). qits-ci
consumed them (`1d01e2b`): the bare-mirror cache, fetch/retry machinery, the CONTENDED
requeue path, and the git binary itself left the image — config is read at the exact
event sha over HTTP. Both deployed and proven live (a drift-forge push ran green with
no other config path in existence). Natural follow-up, not done: qits-projects'
`GitSubmoduleParser` (`git show <rev>:.gitmodules` in its mirror) is the second
consumer of the same verb. qits-workspaces' mirror cache **stays** — merges and
preflights are computations the wire cannot express, not file reads.

Resolved 2026-08-06: the explorer copy (old item 1) shipped — lede approved as-is, the
count punctuated, excluded rows say "not collected" (qits-spa-artifacts `85ea629`,
live via the qits-artifacts webui bump `a72cfd7`, verified in the browser). Note the
shape of that release: a green qits-spa-* run ships nothing by itself — the SPA goes
live only when qits-artifacts bumps its `service/src/main/webui` submodule and
redeploys, queue empty first (self-hosting landmine).

## Open work, not user-gated

- **First real GC sweep**: currently a proven no-op (2-day-old platform, everything
  inside the windows). When the store ages past P30D, run the README's first-sweep
  choreography (review the per-repo or global dry-run → H2 backup + blob listing →
  sweep → verify store-summary balance, cd restart pulls, evicted proxy package
  re-caches). Nothing sweeps without the review.
- **SHUTDOWN COMPACT** maintenance restart: the only way packument CLOB space comes
  back after proxy evictions; documented in qits-artifacts README, never run by code.
- **ci-screenshots / ci-videos GC**: excluded by configuration today; the user wants an
  own-like "$last versions" strategy for them eventually (out of scope for now).
- **Log-streaming leftovers**: none since 2026-08-05 — qits-events gained its OpenAPI
  export test (every repo has one now). Standing note: qits-artifacts publishes
  `paths: {}` (raw-route service — fine, known).

## Longer-term backlog (from settled plans)

- **Workspace views**: the pre-PoC overview tree shipped; the real model is
  project → epic → workspace views (user's mental model, recorded 2026-08-04) — future
  design work.
- **qits-idp**: machine auth is live platform-wide; the user-auth track of
  qits-idp-plan.md (gateway pointing at idp for humans) remains.
- **Workspace-launched dev services telemetry (LD-b): NOT PLANNED** (user decision
  2026-08-05). Console capture is the answer for both daemons; qits-observability's
  README "missing sender" note is a description, not a TODO.
- **Durable log retention (LG): SETTLED** (user decision 2026-08-05). qits adds no
  external component that cannot be embedded into the Quarkus app — no third-party log
  backend, no sidecar collector. The bounded live window stands; if it ever proves
  insufficient, the only path is a qits-owned persistent store inside
  qits-observability.
- **Git pack GC** (old BD): separate, DFS-gated, untouched by the GC reshape.

## Standing facts and landmines (not in memory files)

- **Release a self-hosting repo only after its epic build drained the queue** — a
  release run's npm install can race the redeploy of the service building it.
- Security model: publish surfaces are tokenless on qits-net by decision; qits-idp
  gates them together when its user track lands. `DaemonOpenPublishTest` and siblings
  pin this — re-gating one surface alone fails the build.
- idp token endpoint is not reachable via gateway; call it on `qits-net`. Machine auth
  is ON live (`QITS_AUTH_MACHINE_REQUIRED=true`); only the `qits-artifacts` idp client
  carries `project=*` (see memory: machine-token-minting).
- Git storage: DFS-only since 2026-08-06 — packs, indexes and reftables are blobs in
  qits-artifacts' own store, cataloged in H2 (`git_pack`/`git_pack_file`); there is no
  file backend, no storage config property, and no `qits-repositories` volume anymore.
  Rollback is roll-forward: every prior image sha serves the same DFS store.
  **Never run `DfsGarbageCollector`**: in a store without deletes it doubles the
  footprint (plan §1.7; posture ⚖2(b) — no git GC, in writing). The git CLI cannot
  open a DFS repo — every operation is the wire protocol; receive-pack is the sole
  writer of everything. `DfsBlockCache` rides its 32 MiB default, which today's whole
  git host fits inside. The rewritten `qits-local-up.sh` wire-seeding flow has not yet
  run a fresh bootstrap end to end — watch the first one.
- musl builder supply-chain flag stands: `FROM localhost:8081/...` + toolchain fetched
  from `more.musl.cc` per build.
- qits-ci: a record targeted by a MapStruct mapper needs `clean` after changing (stale
  generated impl → `NoSuchMethodError`); same family as stale `target/` after source
  deletions. qits-cd joined the family 2026-08-06: after a method-signature change,
  plain `verify` ran callers against the stale class (32 false 500s) — use
  `clean verify` after signature changes.
- GC operational shape: per-repository plan/sweep are subresources under
  `/artifacts/api/gc/repositories/`; pins are fetched per run from qits-cd
  `/cd/api/pins` and qits-ci `/ci/api/daemon`, any failure aborts the whole run; blob
  bytes lag identity deletion by up to two runs (row-less + 7-day grace); Σ(per-repo
  reclaim) ≤ global by design.
- Log export: all eleven services (idp included) carry the explicit
  `quarkus.otel.logs.*` block + an `OtelLogConfigTest` drift guard; the behavioral
  proof lives once, in qits-events (`OtelLogBridgeTest`/`PackagedLogBridgeIT`).
  Resource identity (`service.version` = deploy sha) is injected by qits-cd at
  `docker run`; a service shows it after its first post-2026-08-05 deploy.

## Preserve

- Root untracked user files: `daemon-artifact-identity-plan.md`,
  `workspace-overview-ux.md`.
- `services/qits-workspaces/.claude/` is user-owned and untracked.
- Do not reintroduce EventStream as a CI/Workspaces submodule or reactor module.
- QuarkusTest on this host: pass `-Dquarkus.http.test-port=0` (8081 is the npm
  registry).
- Moving the daemon pin stays a human act: edit cd run-args volume + compose, restart
  qits-cd, then redeploy qits-ci — in that order (qits-cd caches run-args at boot).
